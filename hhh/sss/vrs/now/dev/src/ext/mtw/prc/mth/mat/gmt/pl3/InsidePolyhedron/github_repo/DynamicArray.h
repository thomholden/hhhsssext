/** A class implementing an array that can grow dynamically. Very similar to std::vector.
The main difference is the insertLast_unsafe method, which is faster than insertLast (or 
std:vector's push_back) because it doesn't check wheter the array has sufficient capacity 
before inserting a new element.
Use this to save a few CPU-cycles when you can guarantee that the capacity is sufficient.
Note: The clear() function does not call destructors, if destruction is necessary,
this must be taken care of by the caller.
