%% Algorithmic Trading with MATLAB: Intraday trading
% This demo develops and tests a simple exponential moving average trading
% strategy. It encorporates obtaining data from the Bloomberg BLP datafeed.

% This script is based on the code from the webinars "Algorithmic Trading
% with MATLAB - 2010", and "Automated Trading with MATLAB - 2012", by
% Stuart Kozola.

%% Pre-trading tasks
% Add blpapi3.jar to java path
javaaddpath('C:\blp\API\blpapi3.jar')

%% Fetch equity data from Bloomberg BLP datafeed
% This time get intraday data instead of daily data

equity = 'SBK'; % Standard Bank

startTime = today - 1 ; % yesterday's data
endTime = floor(now);
annualScaling = sqrt(250*7*60); 

c = blp; % Connect to Bloomberg V3 Communications Server

Ticker = strcat(equity,' Equity');

% rather than daily data, get raw tick data:
intradayData = timeseries(c,Ticker,{startTime,endTime}); % gives back trade, time stamp, price, quantity

intradayDates = cell2mat(intradayData(:,2));
intradayPrices = cell2mat(intradayData(:,3));

%% Open a parallel computing environment
% We will be performing many more backtests on a larger data set than
% before, so we would like to take advantage of as many processors as we
% can in order to speed up the computation.  MATLAB's Parallel Computing
% Toolbox makes this straightforward.  First, we open a pool of parallel
% workers:

% Use all the cores on my laptop
if matlabpool('size') == 0
    matlabpool local
end

% Then we use MATLAB's |parfor| construct to parallelize our |for|-loops:

%% Perform the parameter sweep
% We will sweep not just across many combinations of leading and lagging
% averages, but we will furthermore sweep across many different
% granularities of data in an effort to find the 'best' frequency to use.
% The variable 'ts' below is the sampling time and varies from 1 tick up
% to 2 ticks (i.e.: about 1 hour). We could sweep through in minutes, but
% for convenience we will use ticks.

seq = generateSpacedInts(1, 200, 25);

range = {seq,seq};
llfun =@(x) leadlagFun(x,intradayPrices,annualScaling);

tic
[~,param,sh,xyz] = parameterSweep(llfun,range);
toc


leadlag(intradayPrices,param(1),param(2),...
            annualScaling)
xlabel('Frequency')

%% 
% The ideal values are a leading indicator of 43 and a lagging indicator of
% 66 ticks
