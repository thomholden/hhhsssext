%% Segmented Memory Averaging using MATLAB
% This example connects to an Agilent scope over TCPIP and sends SCPI
% commands to initiate a segmented mode acquisition and then
% averages the segments together before displaying the final, averaged 
% waveform in MATLAB
% 
% Note that this demos does not require drivers or any other layers in the
% software stack. It does however require connectng to an Agilent
% oscilloscope. The user can alternatively use the IPAddress "localhost" if
% MATLAB is installed directly on the oscilloscope.

%% Interface configuration and instrument connection

% Change the IP address to match your instrument's IP address
% Use 'localhost' if running from MATLAB installed directly on scope
IPAddress = 'localhost';
scopePort = 5025;

% Create a TCPIP object. Agilent instruments use port 5025 to send SCPI
% commands and receive data so use that information.
tcpipObj = instrfind('Type', 'tcpip', 'RemoteHost', IPAddress, 'RemotePort', scopePort, 'Tag', '');

% Create the TCPIP object if it does not exist
% otherwise use the object that was found.
if isempty(tcpipObj)
    tcpipObj = tcpip(IPAddress, scopePort);
else
    fclose(tcpipObj);
    tcpipObj = tcpipObj(1);
end

% Set the buffer size. Change this buffer size to slightly over the number
% of bytes you get back in each read
tcpipObj.InputBufferSize = 350000;
% Set the timeout value
tcpipObj.Timeout = 1;
% Set the Byte order
tcpipObj.ByteOrder = 'littleEndian';
% Open the connection
fopen(tcpipObj)

%% Instrument Setup
% Now setup the instrument using SCPI commands. refer to the instrument
% programming manual for your instrument for the correct SCPI commands for
% your instrument.

% Set acquisition mode to segmented
fprintf(tcpipObj, ':ACQUIRE:MODE SEGMENTED');

% Set total number of points per segment
fprintf(tcpipObj, ':ACQUIRE:POINTS 40000');

% Set sample rate
fprintf(tcpipObj, ':ACQUIRE:SRATE 40e9');

% Turn interpolation off for faster averaging
fprintf(tcpipObj, ':ACQUIRE:INTERPOLATE OFF');

% Set total number of segments over which to average
fprintf(tcpipObj, ':ACQUIRE:SEGMENTED:COUNT 100');

% If needed, set the timebase
fprintf(tcpipObj, ':TIMEBASE:SCALE 100e-9');

% Force a trigger to capture segments
fprintf(tcpipObj,'*TRG');

% Depending on how many segments are captured, a  pause may be necessary in
% order to account for the time required to capture all of the segments
pause(2);

% Specify data from Channel 1
fprintf(tcpipObj,':WAVEFORM:SOURCE CHAN1'); 

% Get the data back as a BYTE (i.e., INT8)
fprintf(tcpipObj,':WAVEFORM:FORMAT BYTE');

% Set the byte order on the instrument as well
fprintf(tcpipObj,':WAVEFORM:BYTEORDER LSBFirst');
fprintf(tcpipObj, 'WAVEFORM:STREAMING OFF');

% Get the preamble block
preambleBlock = query(tcpipObj,':WAVEFORM:PREAMBLE?');

% The preamble block contains all of the current WAVEFORM settings.  
% It is returned in the form <preamble_block><NL> where <preamble_block> is:
%    FORMAT        : int16 - 0 = BYTE, 1 = WORD, 2 = ASCII.
%    TYPE          : int16 - 0 = NORMAL, 1 = PEAK DETECT, 2 = AVERAGE
%    POINTS        : int32 - number of data points transferred.
%    COUNT         : int32 - 1 and is always 1.
%    XINCREMENT    : float64 - time difference between data points.
%    XORIGIN       : float64 - always the first data point in memory.
%    XREFERENCE    : int32 - specifies the data point associated with
%                            x-origin.
%    YINCREMENT    : float32 - voltage diff between data points.
%    YORIGIN       : float32 - value is the voltage at center screen.
%    YREFERENCE    : int32 - specifies the data point where y-origin
%                            occurs.
